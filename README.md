# interactive-card-details

this project is card related project it has form validation which simplifies the user to know if he/she write the info in wrong format or 
one of the input fields or all are empty,
also some of the exciting parts that i liked are : the user can see the name,card-number and etc on the card at the same time that he/she is
writing in the input fields.
